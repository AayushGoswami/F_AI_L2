            <p>
                Welcome to our AI-powered assistant, a collaborative creation by <b>Aayush Goswami</b> and <b>Om Modi</b>. 
                This platform is designed specifically for doctors, offering a streamlined way to summarize critical 
                information from medical reports. By simply uploading a PDF or an image of a medical report, our intelligent 
                system quickly processes the data and provides concise, accurate summaries to assist healthcare professionals 
                in making informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This current version is a <b>Prototype</b>, showcasing the potential of AI in simplifying medical documentation 
                and analysis. While it focuses on summarizing medical reports, it has been designed with scalability in mind. 
                Our platform is a stepping stone toward a more comprehensive solution that can handle complex medical 
                documentation effortlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Future iterations aim to expand the platformâ€™s capabilities, including advanced analysis of X-ray reports, 
                ECG readings, and other diagnostic tools. This evolving project reflects our commitment to enhancing medical 
                workflows and empowering healthcare professionals with cutting-edge technology.
